# 113478A Functional Programming

This repository contains materials for the Functional Programming course (Clojure).

## Final Project

The final project is an illustration/demonstration of the concepts discussed during the lectures.

### Expectations
- **Goal**: Demonstrate intuitive understanding of concepts like Lambda forms, bindings, persistence, macros, etc.
- **Scale**: It doesn't have to be a large or complete project. A small library of functions or a toy problem (shopping cart, to-do list, etc.) is sufficient.
- **Implementation**: Focus on writing idiomatic Clojure code.
- **Suggested Ideas**:
    - Re-implementing core functions (map, reduce, filter).
    - Implementing custom macros (e.g., a custom `let` or threading macros).

### Grading & Exam
- **Format**: The "exam" is a dialogue-based code review/discussion. You will share your screen and demonstrate your code.
- **Focus**: The discussion will probe your intuition about how the code works and the underlying concepts (e.g., "what happens if this reduction is not tail-call optimized?").
- **Requirements**: No need for formal submission or PowerPoint presentations. Just be ready to discuss your code.

### Logistics
- **Deadlines**: Grades must be submitted before the next semester starts.
- **Scheduling**: Book a 30-minute slot via the Calendly link (to be provided in January).
